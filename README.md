# Introdunction 
These are exercises for the course **Machine Learning Theory and Practice** (**Apprentissage statistique**) at **Ecole Centrale de Nantes**, France, taught by **Prof. Diana MATEUS LAMUS**, to whom I am very grateful for the very detailed course and the jupyter notebook exercises (all rights reserved)

The course will focus on:
1. Dimensionality Reduction
2. Support Vector Machines
3. Random Forests
4. Neural Networks
5. Deep Learning

All exercises are done in python, using libraries such as numpy, sklearn, matplotlib.pyplot, etc.

*This course is in progress and TPs for each section will be uploaded as they are completed*

# Run
You can clone or download the code and images directly to run jupyter notebook. The default path in the code is the folder 'images' containing all images in the same directory as the jupyter notebook, you can change this default path in the code.
